I have used CoinCap API: https://docs.coincap.io/ .

Implemented functionality:

- It is a multi-page application with navigation.

- Main page displays the top 10 currencies that were returned by API.

- Page with the ability to view detailed information about the currency: price, volume, price change, in which markets it can be purchased and at what price.
(Click on any currency on main page to view detailed information)

- Possibility of searching for currency by name.
(Top field on main page)

- Usage of MVVM.
